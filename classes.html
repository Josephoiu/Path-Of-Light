    <h2>
      Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms
      at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but
      deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are
      ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting
      position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be
      grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
